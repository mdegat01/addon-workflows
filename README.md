GitHub Actions Workflows for mdegat01's Home Assistant Add-ons.

## About

This repository contains GitHub Actions Workflows that are shared across my other
Home Assistant Add-ons. Putting them here allows them to be maintained in one place
and shared across existing and future Add-ons.

While these workflows are public, they are subjected to change and not
versioned in terms of releases. Using them from this repository directly for
other project is possible, but not recommended for that reason.

## Changelog & Releases

Unlike other Home Assistant Add-ons projects provided in this organization, this
repository isn't versioned (in terms of releases).

If you want to see what has changed, please see the commit history of the
main branch: <https://github.com/mdegat01/addon-workflows/commits/main>

## Support

  [CentralCommand][forum-centralcommand] there.

  I am CentralCommand#0913 there.

You could also [open an issue here][issue] GitHub.
